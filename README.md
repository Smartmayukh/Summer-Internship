# Summer-Internship in IIT Kharagpur

SERB sponsored project. Project Title: " Development of High-Performance Multimodal Hybrid Energy Harvester and its Utilization to Implement Self-Powered Sensor System "

This is my summer internship under the supervision of Banibrata Mukherjee.In this project I worked on Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting in vehicles where I designed both the harvester as well as the associated circuits which include sub circuits like Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor, Boost Converter with feedforward and feedback.

If anyone wants to further my studies in form of a paper feel free to do so. Reach out to me @ mayukhmalidas322@gmail.com
